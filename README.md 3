OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT:

This project is a simple calculator application created using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/).
**FEATURES:
   * User Input: Prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
   * Error Handling: Validates user inputs to ensure they are correct (e.g., valid numbers and operations) and handles divisions by zero.
   * Continuous Use: After performing a calculation, the user is asked if they would like to perform another calculation.

Future Enhancements:
   * Add support for more complex mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots).
   * Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
   * Allow users to save and load previous calculation results.
   * Add a history feature to keep track of past calculations.
